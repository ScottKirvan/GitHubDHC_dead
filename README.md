I do a lot of writing in Markdown, mostly for things that I'm doing up on [GitHub](https://github.com/). ([Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is an great editor for this).  I was running into some frustration with the formatting not mapping really well between Obsidian and GitHub, when I thought, "there has to be a theme for this!"  I found [@krios2146's](https://github.com/krios2146) awesome [Obsidian GIthub Theme](https://github.com/krios2146/obsidian-theme-github).  

It was close, but not really the way *my* GitHub looks (I use the GitHub Dark High Contrast theme when I'm working online), so I decided to start hacking the css a bit to see how close I could get.  The look of GitHubDHC is different enough from the original theme that I decided to start a new fork based on Vladimir's really nicely done Obsidian GitHub Theme -- it's worth checking out - he did all the initial work and the Kanban theme'ing - it's really good.  

I'm not a css creator and I'm sure I've used some poor practices and there's probably some bugs in here (editing modes can get funky!) - but enjoy - I've been using it a ton lately and I'm really finding it difficult going back to the more normal Obsidian themes now.  I started with Vladimir's css, comparing it to GitHub's own DHC css (`ctrl-shift-i`), and have relied on several other themes to help me understand how themes work in obsidian.

This theme DOES NOT support Obsidian's light color scheme, and I'm not sure if any of the Vladimir's original colorblind colorschemes are still working or not.  I welcome the help from anyone that wants to work on this stuff, plus, GitHub uses a lot of fun style tricks in their page rendering that would be cool to see implemented.
